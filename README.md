## Bikeshare Pollution Analysis
#### Does more Citibike use Coorelate with Decreased Carbon Monoxide Levels?

Remake of final project: analysis of increased bikeshare use and level of Carbon Monoxide in NYC (2013 - Present)

## Rationale
I think the some idea that many of us take for granted need to be put to the test. It's logical and intuitive that if a city moves away from automobile usage to another form of transportation that doesn't have exhaust, the air quality ought to be better. Yet as this [article](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2017/06/21/the-science-is-clear-more-highways-equals-more-traffic-why-are-dots-still-ignoring-it/) suggests, the common, taken-for-true assumptions, expecially when it comes to transportation, might not always be correct.

## Hypothesis
I hypothesized that increased bikeshare usage would be coorelated with **better air quality.** There are many lurking variables in this analysis such as seasonality, EPA regulation changes, increased purchase and use of inefficient, large, vehicles as gasoline prices are relatively low.

## Methods 
I used Python packages Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib for loading and wrangling, R for linear regression and outlier considerations, and Tableau for the final visual. 

## Data
Using data from [NYC EDC](http://www.nyaqinow.net/) and [Citibike's own internal datasets](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)
